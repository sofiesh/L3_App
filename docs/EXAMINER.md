# EXAMINER
This repository contains of a module `L2M`, a test library `L2T` and the app `L3A` with the user interface implementing the module. Documentation for users and developers can be found in `docs/`as well as in README.md located in each of the projects.

The requirement of the course to keep the module re-useable is fulfilled as the module is imported to the L3A application via app.js.
